                <h1>Hello, I'm Vaishnavi</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a passionate web developer currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at Malla Reddy Engineering College for Women.
                    My journey into web development began with a curiosity about how websites are built and has evolved into a deep interest in creating intuitive and responsive user experiences.

                <p>
                    As a third-year student, I've gained hands-on experience with various web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I'm continuously learning and exploring new tools and frameworks to enhance my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe in the power of the web to connect people and ideas, and I'm excited to contribute to projects that make a positive impact. Whether it's building a personal portfolio or collaborating on open-source initiatives, I'm eager to apply my knowledge and grow as a developer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, participating in hackathons, and staying updated with the latest trends in web development.
